    <h2>Hi! I'm <span id="name">Alex Krawiec</span>, front-end developer and technical writer</h2>
    <p>I have a decade of experience working on the web. After receiving my Economics degree from UC Davis, I took roles in marketing, SEO, project management, and content at Bay Area startups. In 2016 I took an interest in web development and completed a part-time web-development class at General Assembly before jumping into the six-month Galvanize Web Development Immersive program. With the skills I picked up, I now work as a developer and technical writer.
